# ClassicFCT
Highly customizable "Floating Combat Text" addon with text anti-overlap behavior similiar to that of WoW Classic.
 

Use "/cfct" command to open the options interface.
 

Currently there are 2 configuration presets built-in: "Classic" and "Mists of Pandaria"
Users can create their own presets.
 

The addon allows for a high degree of customization:
- Text display area can be positioned in 3 ways: 
  - to screen center (with x, y offsets)
  - to the target nameplate
  - to every individual nameplate (anti-overlap doesnt work in this mode courtesy of Blizzard)
  - If no nameplate is available (in case the target dies or moves off-screen), text display area can fall back to screen center.
- Animations: "Fade In", "Fade Out", "Directional Scroll", "Pow".
- Configurable animation timing, scale and duration.
- Font face, style, size, custom color or by damage type.
- Spell icons for each damage/heal event.
